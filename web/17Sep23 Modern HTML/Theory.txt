Q. list out the features of html5
Ans. HTML5, the fifth and latest version of the Hypertext Markup Language, introduced a variety of new features and enhancements for web development. Some of the key features of HTML5 include:

1. Semantics: HTML5 introduced new elements like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, and `<aside>`, providing better structure and semantics to web pages.

2. Multimedia Support: Native support for audio and video elements via `<audio>` and `<video>` tags, allowing embedding media directly without third-party plugins like Flash.

3. Canvas: The `<canvas>` element enables dynamic rendering of graphics, animations, and visualizations through JavaScript.

4. Scalability Vector Graphics (SVG): HTML5 includes support for SVG, allowing the integration of vector graphics directly into web pages.

5. Offline Web Applications: Through features like Application Cache (`manifest` attribute), HTML5 allows web applications to work offline by caching resources locally.

6. Geolocation: HTML5 offers native support for accessing a user's geographic location through the Geolocation API.




Q. What are HTML Entities? List out 5 commonly used HTML entities?

Ans.  HTML entities are special codes or characters used to display characters that have special meanings in HTML or characters that cannot be easily typed or rendered directly in HTML.

five commonly used HTML entities:

1. `&lt;` - Less Than Sign (<): This entity is used to display the less than symbol (<) in HTML without it being interpreted as an opening tag.
   
2. `&gt;` - Greater Than Sign (>): Similar to the less than sign entity, this displays the greater than symbol (>) without it being interpreted as a closing tag in HTML.

3. `&amp;` - Ampersand (&): This entity represents the ampersand character (&) itself in HTML. It is used to avoid interpretation as the start of an entity.

4. `&quot;` - Quotation Mark ("): Used to display a double quotation mark (") in HTML, typically within attribute values surrounded by double quotes.

5. `&nbsp;` - Non-Breaking Space: Represents a non-breaking space in HTML. It is used to add space between words or elements that prevent browsers from collapsing consecutive spaces into one.



Q. Define accessibility in the context of web development? Discuss why it's essential to create accessible websites and how it benefits different user groups?
Ans. Accessibility in web development refers to the practice of designing and developing websites and web applications in a way that ensures they can be used and accessed by people with diverse abilities and disabilities. The aim of web accessibility is to provide equal access and an inclusive experience to all users, regardless of their physical or cognitive abilities, technological limitations, or environmental factors.

Accessible websites ensure that everyone, including people with disabilities such as visual, auditory, motor, cognitive, or neurological impairments, can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the content and functionalities.

it Improved accessibility often leads to better overall user experience for all users. Clear and well-structured content benefits not only users with disabilities but also users on mobile devices or in challenging environments.

Web accessibility benefits different user groups in various ways:

Visually Impaired Users: Screen readers can interpret text and describe images when alternative text (alt text) is provided, enabling visually impaired users to understand content.

Hearing Impaired Users: Subtitles or transcripts for audio and video content help users with hearing impairments access multimedia content.

Motor Impaired Users: Keyboard navigation, skip links, and sufficient clickable/tap targets aid users who rely on alternative input methods or assistive technologies due to motor disabilities.


Q. List any 3 ways which help us in improving the accessibility of HTML
Ans. 
1. Employing semantic HTML elements helps in creating a clearer structure for your content, aiding both users and assistive technologies to interpret and navigate your website more effectively. Utilize elements such as <header>, <nav>, <main>, <footer>, <section>, and <article> appropriately to provide meaningful structure to your content.

2. Always include descriptive alternative text (using the alt attribute) for images within <img> tags. This descriptive text assists users who rely on screen readers by conveying the content and purpose of the image.

3. Make sure that all interactive elements on your website can be accessed and used via keyboard navigation alone. This means ensuring that users can move through links, forms, and other interactive elements without the need for a mouse. This is crucial for individuals who may have mobility impairments and rely on keyboard navigation or alternative input devices.
