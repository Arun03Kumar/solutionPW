  <p>A favicon (short for "favorite icon") is a small icon associated with a website that appears in various places, such as browser tabs, bookmarks, and the browser's address bar. It serves as a visual identifier for the website, helping users easily recognize and differentiate between multiple open tabs or bookmarks.</p>
